# Workbench Backend

Workbench Backend is a lightweight project management backend built as a pilot to experiment with workflows, issue tracking, and collaboration primitives.

It focuses on core capabilities such as projects, tasks, boards, sprints, and activity tracking, with an emphasis on clean architecture, extensibility, and developer experience.

This backend serves as a testbed for ideas, patterns, and infrastructure that may later evolve into a larger open-source or production-grade system.
